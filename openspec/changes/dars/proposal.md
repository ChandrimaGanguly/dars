# Dars: AI Tutoring for Every Student

## The Constraint That Defines Us

**$0.10 per student per month.**

This isn't a target—it's a commitment. If we can't deliver value at this price point, we're not solving the problem. Every technical decision flows from this constraint.

---

## The Problem

260 million children are out of school. Millions more sit in classrooms but aren't learning. In India, half of Grade 5 students cannot read a Grade 2 text.

The children who need tutoring most are the ones who can least afford it.

Current solutions fail because they assume:
- High-end smartphones ($500+)
- Reliable internet
- Parents who can pay $20-50/month
- English fluency

These assumptions exclude the students who need help most.

## Business Value Analysis

### 1. Who Benefits and How

#### Primary Persona: Rina (The Struggling Student)

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Who** | Rina, 14, Grade 7 student in Kolkata |
| **Family** | Father is auto-rickshaw driver (₹15,000/month), mother works as domestic help |
| **Device** | Shares a Redmi 9A (₹7,000 phone) with her younger brother |
| **Current situation** | Falling behind in math; classroom has 45 students, teacher can't give individual attention |
| **Pain point** | Failed last math exam. Parents can't afford ₹2,000/month tuition. Feels embarrassed to ask questions in class. |
| **What Dars gives her** | Private, judgment-free practice. Learns at her pace. Gets help exactly where she's stuck. Builds confidence through daily small wins. |
| **Value delivered** | Catches up to grade level. Passes exams. Stays in school instead of dropping out. |

#### Secondary Persona: Amit Sir (The Overwhelmed Teacher)

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Who** | Amit, 34, math teacher at government school |
| **Situation** | Teaches 3 sections of Grade 7 (135 students total). Earns ₹35,000/month. |
| **Pain point** | Can't identify which students need help until they fail. No time for individual attention. Syllabus pressure means he must move on even if students don't understand. |
| **What Dars gives him** | Students come to class with basic practice done. Fewer students completely lost. (Phase 1: dashboard showing who's struggling) |
| **Value delivered** | More effective classroom time. Students pass at higher rates. Less remedial work. |

#### Tertiary Persona: Priya Didi (The Community Champion)

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Who** | Priya, 28, runs a women's self-help group in the neighborhood |
| **Situation** | Already trusted by families. Helps with government scheme enrollments. |
| **Pain point** | Sees children in her community falling behind. Wants to help but isn't a teacher. |
| **What Dars gives her** | A concrete way to help—just get kids to install Telegram and start. Track who's engaging. |
| **Value delivered** | Becomes education champion in her community. Recognition and purpose. |

### 2. The Problem We're Solving (The "Why")

**The Learning Crisis is Now**

| Fact | Source |
|------|--------|
| 50% of Indian Grade 5 students can't read Grade 2 text | ASER 2022 |
| Only 25% of Grade 5 students can do division | ASER 2022 |
| 260M children globally are out of school | UNESCO |
| Private tutoring costs ₹2,000-5,000/month in urban India | Market research |
| EdTech apps average ₹500-2,000/month | BYJU's, Vedantu pricing |

**Why existing solutions fail for Rina:**

| Solution | Why It Fails |
|----------|--------------|
| Private tutor | ₹2,000/month = 13% of family income. Unaffordable. |
| BYJU's/Vedantu | ₹10,000+/year. Requires good internet. English-first. |
| Khan Academy | Free but requires laptop/tablet, good internet, English fluency |
| YouTube | No personalization. No feedback. Passive consumption. |
| School remedial classes | Teacher has no time. Same ineffective method. |

**Why NOW:**

1. **Smartphone penetration** - Even low-income families now have budget Android phones
2. **AI cost collapse** - Claude Haiku makes quality AI tutoring affordable at scale
3. **Messaging ubiquity** - Telegram/WhatsApp are already daily habits
4. **Post-COVID learning loss** - Students are 1-2 years behind; urgency is high

### 3. Priority Based on Value Delivered

| Priority | Feature | Value to Student | Build Effort | Phase |
|----------|---------|------------------|--------------|-------|
| **P0** | Daily math practice (5 questions) | Core learning loop | Medium | 0 |
| **P0** | Socratic hints when stuck | Actual learning, not just answers | Medium | 0 |
| **P0** | Streaks | Habit formation, retention | Low | 0 |
| **P1** | Bengali language support | Accessibility for target users | Medium | 0 |
| **P1** | WBBSE curriculum alignment | Relevance to actual exams | Medium | 0 |
| **P2** | Teacher dashboard | Teacher buy-in, identify struggling students | Medium | 1 |
| **P2** | Science subject | More value per student | Medium | 1 |
| **P3** | WhatsApp integration | Broader reach, less friction | Medium | 1 |
| **P3** | Parent updates | Family engagement | Low | 1+ |
| **P4** | Study groups | Peer learning | High | 2+ |
| **P4** | Photo-based homework help | Convenience | High | 2+ |

**Prioritization principle:** Features that directly help Rina learn math > Features that help others monitor her > Features that are technically interesting.

### 4. What Happens If We Don't Build This

**For Rina (and millions like her):**

| Without Dars | With Dars |
|--------------|-----------|
| Continues to fall behind in math | Daily practice catches her up |
| Fails Grade 8 board exams | Passes with improved scores |
| Drops out by Grade 10 (45% of Indian students do) | Stays in school |
| Limited to informal labor | Has options for further education |
| Cycle of poverty continues | Potential pathway out |

**The counterfactual is not "Rina uses something else."** It's "Rina gets no help at all."

**At scale (if we succeed):**

| Metric | Without Dars | With Dars (Year 3) |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| Students receiving tutoring help | 0 (can't afford alternatives) | 500,000 |
| Cost to family | ₹24,000/year (unaffordable) | ₹0 |
| Learning improvement | Continued decline | 20%+ improvement in math scores |

**The cost of inaction:** Every year we delay, another cohort of students falls irreversibly behind.

### 5. Success Metrics - How We Know It's Working

#### Phase 0 Metrics (8 weeks, 50 students)

| Metric | Target | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| **Onboarding rate** | >80% of invited install & start | Can we get students to adopt? |
| **Weekly active rate** | >50% practice 3+ days/week | Are they forming habits? |
| **Completion rate** | >70% finish daily practice | Is difficulty calibrated right? |
| **Hint success rate** | >70% reach answer after hints | Does Socratic method work via chat? |
| **Week 4 retention** | >40% still active | Will they stick with it? |
| **Cost per student** | <$0.15/month | Is unit economics viable? |
| **Qualitative** | 1+ "aha moment" story | Is real learning happening? |

#### Phase 1 Metrics (3 months, 500 students)

| Metric | Target | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| **Test score improvement** | >15% improvement in school math tests | Actual learning outcomes |
| **Teacher NPS** | >30 | Do teachers see value? |
| **Organic referrals** | >20% of new students from word-of-mouth | Product-market fit signal |
| **Cost per student** | <$0.10/month | Sustainable at scale |

#### North Star Metric

**Students who improve at least one grade level in math within 6 months of using Dars.**

This is what matters. Everything else is a proxy.

## A Day in Rina's Life

**Rina, 14, Kolkata, West Bengal**

6:30 AM - Her phone buzzes. Telegram message from Dars:

> "Suprabhat Rina! ☀️ Day 12 streak! Ready for today's math challenge?"

She taps "Yes" while eating breakfast.

> "A shopkeeper buys 15 mangoes for ₹300. He sells each for ₹25. What's his profit?"

She thinks, types "75"

> "Close! Let's work through it. What did each mango cost him?"

She calculates: 300 ÷ 15 = 20

> "Bhalo! So he paid ₹20 each and sold for ₹25. What's the profit per mango?"

"5 rupees"

> "Yes! Now for 15 mangoes?"

"75 rupees!"

> "🎉 Excellent! You got there yourself. Tomorrow we'll try percentages. Keep your streak alive!"

**Total interaction time: 4 minutes. Data used: <50KB. Cost to serve: ₹2.**

## The Solution: Chat-First (Telegram → WhatsApp)

### Phase 0: Telegram

**Why Telegram for validation?**
- **Zero API cost** - completely free, no per-message fees
- **Instant deployment** - create bot via @BotFather in minutes, no approval process
- **Rich features** - inline keyboards, formatting, file sharing built-in
- **Growing in India** - 2nd most popular messenger, especially among students
- **Lightweight** - works well on budget Android phones
- **Proves the hypothesis** - validates "will students engage with AI tutoring via chat?"

**The tradeoff:** Students must install Telegram (free, one-time friction).

### Phase 1+: WhatsApp Business API

Once we have engagement data and user testimonials from Phase 0, we can:
- Apply for WhatsApp Business API with proof of traction
- Partner with a Business Solution Provider (Wati, Gupshup, etc.)
- Migrate successful students to WhatsApp for broader reach

This lets us **start today** instead of waiting weeks for WhatsApp approval.

### Core Experience (Phase 0)

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Daily Practice** | 5 questions per day, personalized to level |
| **Socratic Help** | When stuck, Dars guides—never gives answers |
| **Streaks** | Simple gamification that builds habits |
| **Inline Keyboards** | Tap-to-answer for quick interactions |

### What We're NOT Building (Yet)

| Deferred | Why |
|----------|-----|
| WhatsApp integration | Need traction data first; pursue in Phase 1 |
| Native mobile app | Chat interface is sufficient for validation |
| Photo-based input | Adds ML complexity, text works |
| Study groups | Social features add moderation burden |
| Full gamification | Streaks are enough to validate engagement |
| Teacher dashboard | Focus on student experience first |
| Diagnostic assessments | Simple grade selection first |
| Parent updates | Validate student engagement first; add if needed |

## Key Hypotheses to Validate

### Phase 0 must answer:

| # | Hypothesis | Success Metric | Kill Criteria |
|---|------------|----------------|---------------|
| 1 | Students will engage with Telegram tutoring | >50% complete 3+ days/week | <30% engagement after 2 weeks |
| 2 | Socratic method works via chat | >70% reach correct answer with hints | Students give up or demand answers |
| 3 | Streaks drive retention | Week 4 retention >40% | Retention <20% by week 2 |
| 4 | Students will install Telegram for Dars | >80% of invited students onboard | <50% install after 1 week |
| 5 | Cost stays under $0.10/student/month | Actual cost tracking | >$0.25/student/month |

## Technical Approach

### Phase 0 Stack (Lean)

```
┌─────────────────┐
│    Telegram     │
│    Bot API      │
└────────┬────────┘
         │
    ┌────▼────┐

│        │       │  API    │
└────────┘       └─────────┘
```

| Component | Technology | Cost |
|-----------|------------|------|
| Messaging | Telegram Bot API | **FREE** |
| Backend | Python/FastAPI on Railway | Free tier → $5/mo |
| Database | PostgreSQL (Railway/Supabase) | Free tier |
| AI | Claude Haiku + prompt caching | ~$0.02/student/month |

**Estimated cost: $0.02-0.03/student/month** ✓

### Cost Control

1. **Claude Haiku for most interactions** - 20x cheaper than Sonnet
2. **Aggressive prompt caching** - same math explanations reused
3. **Pre-generated content** - common problems cached, not generated live
4. **Rate limiting** - 10 AI interactions/day max

### Content Strategy

**Phase 0: Math only, Grade 6-8**

| Source | Approach |
|--------|----------|
| Problem sets | Curate from open educational resources (Khan Academy, OpenStax) |
| Explanations | Pre-generate with Claude, human review |
| Localization | Translate to Bengali, contextualize (mangoes not apples, rupees not dollars) |
| Curriculum alignment | Map to West Bengal Board of Secondary Education (WBBSE) curriculum |

**Content is NOT AI-generated on the fly.** We curate and cache. AI is used for:
- Adaptive hint generation (Socratic responses)
- Explaining where a student went wrong
- Personalized encouragement

## Addressing Key Risks

| Challenge | How We Handle It |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Telegram adoption** | Partner with school to help students install; it's free and lightweight |
| **Shared devices** | Telegram supports multiple accounts; or use in-bot profile switching |
| **Child safety** | No user-generated content in Phase 0; no group features |
| **Cheating** | Vary problem numbers; focus on understanding not scores |
| **Internet reliability** | Telegram works on slow connections; messages queue when offline |
| **Gender access gaps** | Track M/F engagement; partner with girls' schools specifically |

---

## Open Questions

1. **Telegram adoption** - Will students/parents accept installing a new app? Need to test messaging
2. **School partnerships** - How do we get first 50 students? Personal network? NGO partner?
3. **Content licensing** - Can we use Khan Academy content? Need to verify terms
4. **Local regulations** - Data residency requirements in India?
5. **Champion incentives** - Paid? Volunteer? Recognition-based?
6. **WhatsApp migration path** - When do we have enough traction to apply for Business API?

---

## Why This Will Work

1. **Zero API cost**: Telegram is free, letting us focus budget on AI
2. **Start today**: No approval process, no waiting weeks for WhatsApp verification
3. **Respects constraints**: Designed for $50 phones and 2G networks
4. **Focused**: One subject, one city, one hypothesis at a time
5. **Honest about costs**: $0.10 is the ceiling, not the aspiration
6. **Clear upgrade path**: Telegram validates the model, WhatsApp scales it

Dars doesn't try to replace schools or teachers. It's a daily companion that helps students practice and builds confidence through small wins.

**The best education technology is the one students will actually use.**
