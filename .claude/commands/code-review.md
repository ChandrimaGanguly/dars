I'll provide a comprehensive code review following the Code Reviewer Agent guidelines from `openspec/agents/code-reviewer.md`.

**What I'll Review:**

1. **Correctness & Logic** - Does the code work correctly? Edge cases handled?
2. **Design & Architecture** - SOLID principles, separation of concerns, modularity
3. **Readability & Maintainability** - Clear naming, self-documenting code, complexity
4. **Performance** - N+1 queries, caching, appropriate algorithms
5. **Testing** - Testability, coverage, meaningful tests
6. **Security** - Input validation, injection risks, data handling
7. **Standards & Consistency** - Project conventions, formatting, idioms

**Please provide:**
- The file(s) to review
- Context about what changes are being made
- Any specific concerns you want me to focus on

I'll categorize feedback as:
- 🚫 **Blocker**: Must fix before merging
- ⚠️ **Suggestion**: Should strongly consider
- 💡 **Nitpick**: Optional improvements
- ❓ **Question**: Seeking clarification
- ✨ **Praise**: Highlighting good patterns
